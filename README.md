I am excited to share the successful completion of a data analysis and visualization project during my internship with Mentorness. The project focused on analyzing global CO2 emissions, identifying major contributors, and providing strategic insights for policymakers and public awareness to address climate change.

 Key Objectives:
• Analyzing historical emission trends to reveal global CO2 patterns.
• Identifying top emitters across countries and sectors contributing most to emissions.
• Offering insights to support climate policy mitigation strategies.
• Raising public awareness about the impacts of CO2 emissions and the urgency of climate action.

 Key Insights & Findings:
• China, the USA, and India are the top three emitters, with the energy sector being the largest contributor.
• Per capita emissions in developed nations remain higher, while emissions in developing countries are rapidly increasing.
• The global average CO2 emissions per capita of 3.86 metric tons exceed the sustainable target of 2 metric tons.

 Recommendations:
• Invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
• Promote electric vehicles and public transport to cut down emissions from personal cars.
• Encourage international collaboration to share low-carbon technologies and sustainable practices.
• Increase forest cover and restore ecosystems to absorb CO2.

This project has strengthened my understanding of using data-driven insights for addressing global challenges like climate change and emphasizes the critical role of analytics in shaping sustainable solutions.
